\section{Introduction}

Networks are integral parts of human interaction and hence social science research. If one unit in a network gets treated, the effect may trickle down throughout network. The currently established framework for causal inference relies on SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumprion). It assumes that whether or not one person/unit/node is treated, does not affect any other unit. However, SUTVA breaks down in a network setting. It is therefore imperative to take the interference structure into account. Rather, in policy planning or designing marketing campaigns, a researcher may be interested in studying the propogation of treatment effect itself.

In field experiments on social groups, interference may be substantial. In this project we intend to study intererence models for randomized experiments coducted on social networks and causal inference basis this.

To understand, explain and predict social phenomena, social scientists typically look to individual actors' attributes to explain their behavior (e.g., an increase in an individual's wealth will result in a decrease in that individual's support for government spending on social welfare), or to attributes of the macro context (e.g., an increase in the unemployment rate will lead an individual's support for the party of the president to decrease). However, these two conceptual approaches to explaining individual behavior leave out a potentially powerful class of social dynamics -- interpersonal influence. That is, the behavior of one individual may depend upon the behavior of one or more others (e.g., a person may decide to vote due to their friends claiming to have voted \citep{Bond:2012}). Inferences regarding influence involve the analysis of individual behaviors and the behaviors of those adjacent or nearby in some contact network. However, as in most settings, it is generally not possible to identify the causal effects that map onto the process of social influence in observational data CITE SHALIZI. As such, we need experimental methods to identify causal influence effects.

\section{Research Design}

We plan to re-analzye data from past field experimental studies to understand how conclusions regarding direct effects and interference effects depend upon 

\subsection{tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a list of alternative propagation models to evaluate. (SP)
\end{itemize}


\section{Analysis}

\begin{itemize}

\item Replicating results from the Nickerson paper


The first table contains results of balance test for pre-treatment covariates in the analysis. The p-values are calculates using simple logit regressions. This table shows that there is covariate balance across treatment conditions

\input{tables/table1.for.LaTeX.txt}


The next two tables present regression results. We are modeling the likelihood of voting in favor of SB 24. In the first regression, we study whether the treatment effects differ substantively across districts where support for the governor's spending proposals was low and ones where it was not. This is our key independent variable. Each regression uses a Probit model with standard errors clustered on the 35 matched pairs on which the randomization was based. We use the Zelig program/package in R to incorporate clustered standard errors into the model. The original analysis was performed in STATA. We notice that our estimates are the same as those in the original paper and standard errors are very close as well.

\input{tables/table2A.for.LaTeX.txt}

In the second regression, we also control for whether the legislator was a Republican and the 2004 Presidential election results for the given district.

\input{tables/table2B.for.LaTeX.txt}



\item Present original results from studies that we replicate: Coppock

The Coppock (2014) paper builds upon the New Mexico Legislator experiment conducted by Butler and Nickerson (2011). The next two figures replicate analysis from the original paper, as shown in the Coppock (2014) paper. Figure 1 below replicates the result under the assumption that indrect effecrs are exactly zero. X-axis represents the proposed values for direct treatment effect, Y-axis represents simulated p-values and the colouring is according to the p-values.

\caption{Figure 1}
\end{figure}


Figure 2 shows the heterogeneous effects of treatment. X-axis represents hypothesized effects in higher-support districts as against the hypothesized effects in lower-support districts on Y-axis. Once again, the colour scale indicates the p-value for each pair of hypotheses. Darker region indicates a higher p-value. We observe maximum p-value at effect values (0.05, -0.37) in higher-support and lower-support regions respectively.

\item Replicate Bergan. (SP)
\item Find other network data for the New Mexico legislature. (BD)
\item Find other network data for the New Hampshire legislature (BD)\footnote{For the Legislative Finance Committee, there was no comprehensive list online, so we looked for all members who attended at least one meeting, according to meeting minutes. The Interim Committee memberships are available here \url{http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/misc/Biennial\%20Report\%202006-2008\%20FOR\%20WEB.pdf}}
