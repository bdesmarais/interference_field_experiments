This is the pre-JSM draft; the draft before edits were made for JSM

\noindent  Most social processes involve complex interaction and dependence among units in a network. The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)--the assumption that a unit’s outcome is unaffected by other units’ treatment statuses—is required in conventional approaches to causal inference. When SUTVA is violated, as in networked social interaction, treatment effects spread to control units through the network structure. We evaluate the evidence for spillover effects in data from three field experiments on US state legislatures. Randomized field experiments represent the gold standard in causal inference when studying political elites. It is not possible to bring political elites into the lab, and causal identification with observational data is fraught with problems. We propose new specifications for treatment spillover models, and construct networks through geographical or ideological proximity and co-sponsorship. Considering different combinations of spillover models and networks, we evaluate the robustness of recently developed non-parametric tests for interference. The approaches we illustrate can be applied to any experimental setting in which interference is suspected. \\~\\

\section{Introduction}

Networks are integral parts of human interaction and hence social science research. If one unit in a network gets treated, the effect may trickle down throughout network. The currently established framework for causal inference relies on SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumprion). It assumes that whether or not one person/unit/node is treated, does not affect any other unit. However, SUTVA breaks down in a network setting. It is therefore imperative to take the interference structure into account. Rather, in policy planning or designing marketing campaigns, a researcher may be interested in studying the propogation of treatment effect itself.

In field experiments on social groups, interference may be substantial. In this project we intend to study intererence models for randomized experiments coducted on social networks and causal inference basis this.

To understand, explain and predict social phenomena, social scientists typically look to individual actors' attributes to explain their behavior (e.g., an increase in an individual's wealth will result in a decrease in that individual's support for government spending on social welfare), or to attributes of the macro context (e.g., an increase in the unemployment rate will lead an individual's support for the party of the president to decrease). However, these two conceptual approaches to explaining individual behavior leave out a potentially powerful class of social dynamics -- interpersonal influence. That is, the behavior of one individual may depend upon the behavior of one or more others (e.g., a person may decide to vote due to their friends claiming to have voted \citep{Bond:2012}). Inferences regarding influence involve the analysis of individual behaviors and the behaviors of those adjacent or nearby in some contact network. However, as in most settings, it is generally not possible to identify the causal effects that map onto the process of social influence in observational data \citep{Shalizi:2011}. As such, we need experimental methods to identify causal influence effects.

\section{Research Design}

We plan to re-analzye data from past field experimental studies to understand how conclusions regarding direct effects and interference effects depend upon the network structure.

\subsection{tasks}

The key factors that we will consider in building propagation models are: \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item Distance from the nearest treated node ($d_i$)
\item Number/proportion of treated nodes neighboring each $d_i$
\item Form of spread (linear or non-linear)

\end{enumerate}

** Think of what should go into this table? Can we put empirical models that fit into each of the cells or examples of networks for which such a spreading model will be suitable?

\floatsetup[table]{objectset=centering,capposition=top}
\begin{table}
        \begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\toprule
            &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Distance from treated < 5}}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Distance from treated > 5}}
            \\\cmidrule(r){2-3}\cmidrule(r){4-5}
            &Linear&Non-linear&Linear&Non-linear\\\midrule
            Number of treated neighbors    & 1 & 2
                    & 5 & 6\\
            Proportion of treated neighbors   & 3 & 4
                    & 7 & 8
            \\\bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{The Results}\label{Tab2}
\end{table} 

Tabulates the basic idea of the models we will look at. The linear/non-linear refers to the form taken by the spread of effect. Distance from the nearest treated node is vaguely separated as <5 or >5 for now. Finally, we want to look at the difference in spillovers effects caused due to number of treated neighbors as against proportion of treated neighbors. Potentially, the number/proportion at hops of different lengths can also be considered.

The types of networks we will consider in the analysis are: \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item Grographical proximity
\item Ideological similarity
\item Co-sponsorship

\end{enumerate}

Each of these factors is such, that a treatment such as the message sent through emails in New Hampshire, would possibly spread to untreated units as well. Legislators from adjoining districts may affect each other's opinions through geographic proximity as well as potentially via common issues faced by citizens in their constituencies.

Ideological similarity is a tricky variable because it could be hard to distinguish that from party affiliation. In the New Hampshire paper, there is a need to include this effect in the model since matched pairs are created based on party affiliation. If a Republican candidate receives the treatment, the chances that through various communication channels, he/she will convey the message to the control group candidate from the same party and district, are very high.

Finally, serving on the same committee can also contribute to spreading the effect of a treatment. We must test for any dependence across these three fators before incorporating them into our model. Therefore it is important that we propose and test propogation models that consider the spread of treatment through our network.


**Notes:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Ideological similarity: This should get highest priority in modeling, since I believe, it would be easiest to affect an undecided legislator's vote through similarity in ideas and belief about citizen's issues and how to resolve them. I would propose that we model immediate neighbours to have a 50% chance of receiving treatment and 2nd neighbours a smaller non-zero chance.
\item Grographical proximity: An untreated legislator from adjoining district would be 
\item Co-sponsorship: Serving on the same committee increases the chances of 

\end{enumerate}



\section{Analysis}

We begin this section by reviewing prior methodological work. We will look at two spillover specifications and testing frameworks given in Bowers et. al. and Coppock papers. We will extend their analysis by considering various other specifications for spillover effects. Additionally, we will look into tests other than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.

\subsection{Review of existing methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Bowers et. al. method:} This paper introduces a Fisherian inference algorithm to test for spillover of treatment effect. The model $\mathcal{H}$ is compared against the observed data. The hypothesized model of interference is specified by the researcher. The steps involved in conducting this test are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Assume the "sharp null hypothesis of no effects" i.e. the treatment assignment has no effect on any unit

\item Specify the causal model which describes the change in potential outcomes when treatment assignment changes from \textbf{u} to \textbf{w}; $\mathcal{H}(y_{i, \textbf{u}}, \textbf{w}, \theta)$

\item Potential outcomes from the causal model must be mapped to observed outcomes $y_z$. Treatment assignment in the experiment (\textbf{z}) must be mapped to the uniformity trial ($\mathcal{H}(y_{\textbf{z}}, \textbf{0}, \theta) = \textbf{y}_0$) which is based on the baseline condition of no-treatment assignment i.e. every unit is a control unit

\item Test statistic $\mathcal{T}$ should be a small value when distribution of treated and control outcomes in the adjusted data are similar, and a large value when distributions are dissimilar. We need a sensitive measure to account for similarity on not just the center but also higher-order moments of a distribution. Bowers et. al. recommend the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic

\item Assume that treatment only spreads through edges and the spillover effect only depends on the number of neighbours treated. Spillover effect modeled using a growth curve $\beta + (1-\beta)e^{-\tau^2\textbf{z}^T\textbf{S}}$

\item Generate the distribution of test statistic under our hypothesis. The exact distribution is specified by computing $t_k = \mathcal{T} (\textbf{y}_0, \textbf{Z}_k)$ for each $\textbf{Z}_k \in \Omega$. Alternatively, we can use sampling methods and limit theorems to estimate the distribution from data.

\item p-value calculated using $\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{|\Omega|} I(x_i  > t_k)}{|\Omega|}$

\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Coppock replication:} Coppock builds upon the New Mexico Legislator experiment conducted by Butler and Nickerson (2011). This paper also works with the idea of sharp null of no effects and uniformity trial. Similarity in ideological scores is used as the adjacency matrix. Procedure is as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item W-NOMINATE ideology score calculated for each legislator using rollcall vote data

\item Ideological similarity calculated as $Similarity_{i,j} = \frac{2 - |ideo_i - ideo_j|}{2}$

\item Raw exposure calculated as $Raw exposure_i =  \sum_{j=1}^{n}Similarity_{i,j} * z_j, j \neq i$. However, this specification introduces a correlation between exposure - direct treatment, exposure - ideology and exposure - other unobservable characteristics. Therefore we further process the raw exposures.

\item To calculate expected exposures, we simulate exposures under a large number of randomizations. Each randomization where legislator \textit{i} is in treatment is indexed as \textit{k} (\textit{k} = 1, 2, ..., K) and where legislator \textit{i} is in control is indexed as \textit{l} (\textit{l} = 1, 2, ..., L) $$Expected exposure_{i, z_i=1} =  \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n}Similarity_{i,j} * z_{j,k}}{K}, j \neq i, z_{i,k}=0$$ $$Expected exposure_{i, z_i=0} =  \frac{\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{j=1}^{n}Similarity_{i,j} * z_{j,l}}{L}, j \neq i, z_{i,l}=1$$

\item Using ideological similarity scores in the adjacency matrix, Coppock separates out the direct treatment effect and spillover occurring through the network.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Extensions of Coppock analysis}

We consider several extensions of the Coppock method, all applied to the Butler and Nickerson data. We would like to apply the same methods to the Bergan data as well. (The ones in red are planned extensions, in the order of priority)

\begin{itemize}

\item Consider k (=3, 5, 8, 12) neighbors according to ideological scores to form adjacency matrix. A tie between i and j indicates that legislator j is one of the k-nearest neighbors to i. This generated some ties. We will try the following two ways of taking care of the ties:

\color{red}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose, among the ties in the k closest neighbors for i, those nodes for which i is the closest neighbor. To illustrate, if i is equally close to j and h, we ask whether i ranks higher on j's list of closest neighbors. If yes, then we kick out h. If no, we keep j and h if i ranks equally on j and h's neighbor list, or kick out j if h ranks i more highly.

\item Look at the number of nodes for which j is the nearest neighbor and in some way account for the j's influence on that basis? 
1. Look at control unit i
2. Calculate a composite score that indicates the ranking of i for each of its k neighbors (similar to the ranking idea you have suggested)
3. Estimate a parameter to see if change in composite score leads to a change in propensity for changing the outcome
4. We can consider modeling this parameter as something other than linear effect

For example, say we are under k=3 condition. If I am a control unit and I am the lowest in the proximity of all of my 3 neighbors, I am less likely to receive a spillover; as compared to if I was in the highest proximity of all three of them (the two extremes). We might have to condition this somehow on the treatment status of my neighbors though.

\end{enumerate}

\color{black}
\item Consider committee network instead of ideological network, where a tie between i and j indicates that they have served on two or more committees together

\color{red}
\item Use number of shared committees in adjacency matrix and see the results

\item Separate out the high and low support district in original data and conduct separate analyses. This would explain the direction of the spillover effect much better. Conduct this analysis with ideological network as well as committee network

\item Replicate all of these models (with suitable modifications) to the Bergan (New Hampshire) data

\item Include geographical network in both dataset and extend analysis

\item Consider different spillover models

\item Consider weighted combinations of different networks to estimate a $\gamma$

\item Explore the idea of using communities to model spread across the network

\end{itemize}




\subsection{tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Replicate Bergan. (SP)
\item Find other network data for the New Mexico legislature. (BD)
\item Geography and ideology data for New Hampshire (BD)
\item Produce cosponsorship, ideology and geography estimates for both Bergan and Nickerson (SP \& BD)
\item For at least two spreading models (SP \& BD)
\item Replicate Nyhan (SP)
\end{itemize}


Records of standing committee membership in the 16 standing committees in place during the 2008 regular session was obtained from the New Mexico Legislative Council Service Librarian. 

\section{Summary}

So far, we have replicated the two papers mentioned earlier; \citep{bowers2012reasoning} and \citep{coppock2014information}. As of now, we will go ahead with the Coppock method alone. Bowers method is suitable if the outcome (y) is continuous. For binary outcomes, the uniformity trial conversion leads to ties in the sub-vectors we will use to perform KS test. In our datasets, outcome variable is voting decision; essentially binary. The codes are available in the appendix. So far we have worked on the New Mexico legislators dataset from \citep{butler2011can} and considered network based on ideological similarity. The plan ahead for this paper is:

\begin{itemize}

\item Consider different diffusion models by varying the distance from treated node, number/proportion of treated neighbors and form of spread of treatment
\item Consider other legislator networks depending on geographical proximity and co-sponsorship
\item Consider additional test statistic such as the Anderson-Darling test and other tests mentioned in \citep{rosenbaum2012interference} (Mann-Whitney U test, Control Median test etc.)

\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Appendix 1A}

In this section, we will look at user-defined R-functions that replicate the \citep{bowers2012reasoning} methodology. This contains four steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item A function to transform the observed outcomes into potential outcomes for any treatment assignment w
\item A function to separate the hypothesized treatment effect
\item A function to calculate test statistic
\item A function to calculate the p-value.
\end{itemize}

The results from the ks.test function in R for calculating Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test statistic are verified with that in Footnote 12 of the paper.

(
Conventional approaches to causal inference rely on the Stable Unit Treatment Value Unit Assumption (SUTVA) i.e. they assume that the outcome of a unit is unaffected by the treatment statuses of other units. They rely on individual-level micro attributes or context-dependent macro attributes to estimate treatment effect. However, most social processes involve complex interaction and dependence among units connected through a network. In this situation, interpersonal interactions influence behavior leading to propagation of treatment effect through network to control units and SUTVA break down. Various factors impact how and how much the treatment effect spreads. It is important to take the interference structure into account in order to estimate the effect of the treatment effect correctly. In policy planning or marketing strategy, understanding the propagation of treatment itself can be of interest. It is generally not possible to identify the causal effects that map onto the process of social influence in observational data (Shalizi and Thomas 2011). Randomized experiments may not always be feasible. Therefore we look at methods suitable for identifying and estimating causal effect using field experiments.
