*Hello everyone. My name is Sayali Phadke. Today I am presenting my work with Bruce Desmarais, from the political science department at Penn State. In this paper, we have developed a method for conducting causal inference on networks. The applications we look at study effects of treatment given to legislators from state legislatures in the United States.

*Let's look at an example to motivate the question. Bergan and Cole conducted a field experiment on the Michigan state legislature in 2012. The units of study were 148 legislators in the state. An anti-bullying bill was coming to floor for a vote shortly after. The researchers had constituents call legislators from their own district, and communicate their support (or not) on the bill. Considering final votes by the legislators as an outcome, the effect of this treatment was estimated using OLS regression. The analysis concluded that receiving calls from constituents increased the likelihood of a legislator to vote in favor of the bill. But is it possible that treated legislators informed their untreated counterparts, hence affecting their outcomes as well? In short, was there a spillover of the treatment effect?

*With this example at the background, we will further motivate this work, followed by a discussion of the method itself. I will take you through a few applications, before concluding with a summary of the paper.

*The seminal analysis by Shalizi and Thomas shows that separating influence and selection using back-door path analysis is virtually impossible in observational data; which is to say that if we suspect the effect of treatment to spread, it is extremely difficult to detect that using observational data. This work motivated us to look at field experiments in our application area.

*So why is it critical to develop special methodology to study this phenomenon? Let us look at this illustrative network plot under randomized treatment assignment. The nodes marked with a T are treated units, and those with a C are control. The control units are color coded based on their proximity to treated units. C0 does not have any treated neighbor, so the spillover or transfer of treatment to C0 may be thought to be minimal. Whereas C1s have one treated neighbor each, and Cs have 2 or more treated neighbors. It is easy to understand that each of these types of control units will experience different levels of spillover, yet it is likely that each of them receives some. Classical causal inference assumes stable unit treatment value, which says that the the outcome of one unit is not affected by the treatment statuses of other units. We see clearly that SUTVA breaks down in such a setup. Most social processes involve complex interaction among units.

*Therefore the need to develop a method that will model spillover of treatment that occurs via network structure, test for these indirect effects, and also study the sensitivity of these estimates to model specifications. We look at applications that have conducted field experiments on Unites State state legislatures.

*Let us begin by discussing the intuition behind this methodology. A researcher, from the knowledge of context, understand the possible ties among units and has a theory about the manner in which spillover can occur. The testing then has to take place at two levels. We need to test for the difference across experimental conditions, and then test for the effect of the treatment or the experiment itself, by evaluating the model against the null.

*In their 2012 paper, Jake Bowers and other political scientists proposed a method to do so. They assumed a sharp null of no effects, that is the treatment has no effect on any unit. In this model spillover depends on the number of treated neighbors, and is modeled as a nonlinear growth curve. We will see the specification in a few slides. But essentially, we model for separate direct and indirect effect parameters.

*Within this framework, KS test statistic is used to compare outcomes across experimental conditions. And these comparisons are conducted under a large number of permutations of treatment assignment vector. Then the p-value is the proportion of permutation statistics that are greater than the observed statistics, in absolute value.

*In specifying such a model for spillovers, several important dimensions must be considered. We need to specify the network through which units must be interacting. Legislators may be communicating as indicated by their ideological similarities. Students may communicate based on the classes they are enrolled in. Neighborhood specifies the set of nodes to which a control unit is exposed. It can either be affected by all units in the network or only its k-nearest neighbors. Finally, we need to specify the mathematical form of the spreading of treatment; the diffusion model. In this, we must think about the distance upto which a treated node can impact the control units. We need to also determine if the amount of spillover received by the control unit would depend on the number of its treated neighbors or the proportion of neighbors that are treated. Finally, whether the effect is linear or non-linear has to be specified.

*To illustrate working with these dimensions, and see some results, we will look at two applications. The first is an experiment conducted by Butler and Nickerson in 2009. In the context of an upcoming spending bill in the New Mexico state legislature, reseachers conducted a field experiment. They sent a letter to the legislators, indicating the opinion of their consitutents, about which way their representative should vote. Initial analysis, that assumed independence across units, concluded that the treatment had a significant effect on the likelihood of voting in favor of the bill. Alexander Coppock extended this analysis in 2014, to include indirect effect of the treatment, as instructed by the Bowers et. al. method. In this analysis, the ideological network, specified by the similarity in ideologies, was considered. Treatment was assumed to spread all across the network, in a linear form.

*Let us look at the results of this analysis. In the left panel, we see the specification of the model. yi,z is the outcome of ith unit under treatment assignment z, and yi,0 is the outcome under the null hypothesis. beta1 is the coefficient for the direct effect, and beta2 for the indirect effect. The gamma function forms the adjacency matrix under treatment assignment z, and g transforms it into a specification for indirect or spillover effect as a function of the network. Due to the setup of the test, higher p-value indicates evidence for effect of the treatment. In the right panel, we have a plot of p-values from this analysis. We conduct the testing over a grid of values of parameters. So on the X-axis, we have beta1s or the direct effects. On the Y-axis are beta2s, or indirect effects. We see that the highest p-value is achieved at (), denoted by the intersection of solid yellow lines. These are the point estimates. The dotted yellow lines denote 95% confidence interval. Under this method, a confidence limit for one parameter, is the value above or below which, all p-values are greater than 0.05, when holding the parameter constant at its point estimate. So for example, confidence interval around the indirect effect parameter is (-0.375, 0.175). This plot tells us that there is a non-zero indirect effect, meaning that there is evidence of spillover in the new mexico experiment.

*We extend this analysis along some of the dimensions mentioned in the earlier slide. Firstly, instead of considering that the entire network inpacts the outcome of control units, we conider only k nearest neighbors. We tested for k as 3,5,8,12. Essentially, ideological distance is dichotomized in this setup. The left panel contains a plot when k=3, and right panel k=12. We notice that even under this specification, we see evidence for spillover effect.

*In the next extension, we use a comittee network instead of ideological network. So legislators now share an edge in the network if they have served on at least one legislative committee together; and the plot for that is in the left panel. And in the right panel is a plot of p-values when the network has an edge if they have served on at least two, or more, committees together. The treatment of receiving calls from constituents does not seem to have propogated via the committee network.

*Finally, we revisit the Michigan state legislature application discussed at the very beginning. If we consider ideological network, where either the entire network affects control outcome, or only k-nearest neighbors affect control outcome; we see no evidence of spillover via ideological network, based on these plots. The point estimate is exactly zero. This result is consistent across various values of k. However, it is important to note here, that lack of an evidence for spillover, does not mean we cannot try to model it wherever interference is suspected. The importance of null findings should not be discounted.

*To summarize the applications; we see that treatment spreads among New Meciso legislature. But for Michigan it doesn't. The important point here, is that spending is a fairly partisan issue, therefore ideology can possibly expect the indirect effect more better.

*So, in conclusion, i want to emphasize yet again, that spillover is possible in any study on interactive groups. Therefore we must carefully model and test for it. We have provided some guidelines for how to go about model specification, and what the most important ideas there are. These dimensions should assist a researcher in a systematic search for spillovers. Such an analysis can also help build simulations and power analysis which can assist a researcher in optimal design or optimal treatment assignment, in future studies.
