How would we expct the treatment to affect untreated units? Caption for figure 2

Non-parametric testing method for interference effects

Coppock implementation/application
Just Bowers method with different choices for diffusion model and the test statistic

BOlded bullets: Diffusion/interference model specification, neighborhood specification, network selection, statistic selection

2X2 table in extenson section showing dimensions (definition of neighborhood coppock or discrete and linear v/s nonlinear spreading effect (proportion of number in the neighborhood

Extensions through specifications of dimensions
-

High p-value is a good thing! Support for those values of effects

Future direction/next steps: other application, apply all the extension ideas


Keep an example ready in your mind

As the neighborhood grows, we would expect a robust result. It is moving when we go to 12, so maybe that's not true
