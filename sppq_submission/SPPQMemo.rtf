\b0 \cf2 In addition to making several specific improvements in response to the reviewers' comments, which we document below, we have revised the introduction to clarify the overall contributions offered by this paper. First, we provide a useful theoretical typology that researchers can draw upon when formulating hypotheses regarding interference. Second, we illustrate the use of this methodology through several novel empirical applications (i.e., via the replications).

\i0\b \cf2 E2 
\i\b0 \cf2 While we do not think there is a problem with replicating and extending existing work, we agree with R3's broader point that you should do more to make clear what your intellectual contribution is in this manuscript; what are scholars learning here that they could not already get from the Bowers article?

\i0\b \cf2 R1.1 
\i\b0 \cf2 Overall, I like this paper, and I think it\'92s a good fit for SPPQ. The literature on elite experiments is growing quickly, and it\'92s useful to both combine recent innovations into a single paper, and to demonstrate how they can be applied to a number of well-known experiments. I\'92m not really convinced that this paper demonstrates any substantial spillover effects, but it does show how one could test for such effects, and I could see the methodology being applied to other field experiments where spillover was more likely (either previous studies, or future studies).\

\i\b0 \cf2  I\'92d like the author to make the unique contribution of this article more clear. It\'92s sometimes difficult to tell how much of the method is taken from other work, and how much is new suggestions. The additional empirical tests are clearly new, but beyond that it gets a bit fuzzy at times. Much of the paper borrows methodology from other publications (with citations throughout). I\'92d like the original contributions of this paper to be made just as clear.\

\i\b0 \cf2 2A. I like the discussion of potential networks that might commonly lead to interference and spillover among state legislators. This is my favorite part of the paper, as it has the potential to guide future research. Again \'96 I\'92d like the author to make clear how much of this is original suggestion versus collecting what\'92s been done elsewhere. Either is worthwhile, in my opinion.\

\i\b0 \cf2 2B. I\'92d like to see more discussion about when each type of network might be most likely to have spillover. For example, we might expect some information to be shared with anyone you contact (in which case committee co-members would be good); whereas in other cases, we might expect information to be shared most with those who are ideologically close to the legislator (in which case ideological proximity would be a more likely choice). Some guidance to authors in the future along these lines would set the piece up to make a bigger contribution to the future literature in this area. \

The description of this experiment is ambiguous to me, and I have trouble following the discussion in the new analyses of the data. The author describes that the treatment increased support for the rebate overall \'93since the vote was popular\'94, but that the treatment also decreased support in districts with low support. The discussion on page 16 is hard to follow \'96 I can\'92t tell when the author is analyzing only districts where the treatment indicated support, only those where the treatment indicated opposition, or all districts together. It seems the original article did at least two of the three groups. I\'92m not sure which ones were replicated, so it\'92s hard to follow the comparisons.\'a0 Also, on page 14, the author says the treatment had a significant effect, but on page 17, says the original effects were not significant. Lastly, do we need all these figures? They look very similar to each other, and take up a lot of space.\

The original experiment is explained very clearly. The author provides additional suggestions on networks to test for interference (beyond those originally proposed on pages 8-9). I don\'92t fully follow the result described on page 26. The words are clear, but I can\'92t grasp the intuition of why we would expect that kind of spillover to happen, or why that kind of spillover follows the original study. More explanation and discussion from the author would be useful here. Why would one legislator\'92s responsiveness to an out-of-district constituent go down if other legislators from a district with similar racial composition also received an e-mail from an out of state constituent? Is it assumed that they would share that they received the e-mail, and suspect there was an experiment? Or assume the other person would do it? I don\'92t follow the logic.\

\i\b0 \cf2 One of the most serious problems in the manuscript is that it takes a good idea \'96 reminding scholars of the possibility of SUTVA in experiments \'96 and then mostly rehashes work presented by Bowers et al. in Political Analysis. I do not see what is particularly novel about the contribution, as potential SUTVA violations (whether studying state legislators or households or neighbors in GOTV studies) is well known. The manuscript argues that it would be best to model the network first, and then conduct treatments, but none of the three empirical analyses do so.\'a0 Mainly, this article does not add a significant contribution to the study of state politics or state legislatures, nor is it methodologically novel, as it simply reminds the reader of SUTVA assumptions in experiments.\

\i\b0 \cf2 1. There is not a significant contribution in this article, and it is mostly a rehash of other work. The article\'92s target audience appears to be scholars of experiments in states and state legislatures, and the authors assert that SUTVA violations are potentially severe in studies of small groups like legislatures. I am not convinced that SUTVA violations are likely in many of the types of state legislative experiments that the authors critique and replicate.\'a0 \

\i\b0 \cf2 Audit studies with minimal email or constituent contact are unlikely to have spillover.\'a0 For instance, in a professionalized legislature, in which there are many staff and legislators regularly receive 100s if not 1000s of emails per week, it strains credulity to think that a legislator is going to forward an email from a constituent to someone who is ideologically similar with them (ideological similarity is how the spillover network is modeled by the authors).\'a0 I could be persuaded that legislators or their staff may speak to one another about particularly unusual interventions (or poorly designed interventions that are simply bad scholarship).\'a0 But in the replications that the authors test, two of the three studies are fairly typical things legislators might receive.\'a0 In these typical interventions, it is not clear that there would necessarily be spillover effects. Having worked in a legislative office as a staff member, I would not have thought to discuss with another office when a minor request was received by a constituent.\

\i\b0 \cf2 If anything, given that the effects remain similar to the initially published studies, the small or null effects produced by the authors\'92 replications suggest there are not spillover effects or SUTVA violations in these past studies (consistent with my expectations, but inconsistent with the authors\'92 argument).\'a0 Or, given that the results of the previous studies hold in the authors\'92 replications, if there was spillover in the past studies, then the authors of this manuscript have not modeled it correctly.\

\i\b0 \cf2 2. I am concerned that the network is modeled as ideological similarity between legislators. It is possible that a grassroots lobbying experiment (e.g., the Bergan and Cole study the authors replicate) has a treatment that is more likely to affect liberal legislators.\'a0 This would mean not that there is necessarily a SUTVA violation, but instead that the treatment was conditionally more effective with liberal legislators.\'a0 The authors do not justify their use of ideological similarity as the path of spillover in the manuscript.\'a0 Do the authors theoretically expect that legislators will forward grassroots emails to other legislators of similar ideology?\'a0 This does not seem likely, though some other network of spillover is definitely possible (friend networks, cohorts when elected, etc.) yet the authors do not model such a network.\

\i\b0 \cf2 3. The empirical results suggest that there are not significant spillover effects in these past studies.\'a0 This undercuts the authors' argument substantially. Or it suggests there is nothing specific to state legislative studies to be learned that does not apply more broadly to all field experiments.\'a0 This then gets the reader back to the Bowers et al. piece, which is this more general contribution regarding experimental spillover.\
