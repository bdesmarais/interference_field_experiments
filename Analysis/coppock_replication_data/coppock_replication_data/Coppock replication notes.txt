Problems with Coppock replication:

- Could not work with the packages spdep and maptools (in case if I need them)

- Assuming sb24 to be the y_observed column

- Used earlier code to generate similarity scores

- Considering the similarity score matrix to be the adjacency matrix. Basically ideological similarity determines network adjacency

- Randomization is already taking place within the expected exposure calculation. Then what is the meaning of the randomizations we conduct within our permutation testing?

- Implementing the test statistic calculation
